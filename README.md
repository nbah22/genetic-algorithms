Genetic-algorithms
==================
This program based on a genetic algorithm is aimed on finding the best configuration of knights on a chess desk which follows these simple rules:
- The more knights - the better
- The more of them can occupy each other - the worse

The genetic algorithm lying in the base of this project can also be applied to different tasks.

To launch the project, execute _Launch.py_

**TODO:**
- Improve `redraw()`
- Make individuals differentiate
  *Think of a better use of `likeness()` function
  *Maybe `mutate(f(likeness()))`?
- Add some description and documentation
- Breeding display to see which genes came from whom
  *Some kind of genealogical tree
