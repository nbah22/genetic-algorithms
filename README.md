Genetic-algorithms
==================
This program based on a genetic algorithm is aimed on finding the best configuration of knights on a chess desk which follows these simple rules:
- The more knights - the better
- The more of them can occupy each other - the worse

The genetic algorithm lying in the base of this project can also be applied to different tasks.

To launch the project, execute _Launch.py_

**TODO:**
- Make individuals differentiate
- Add some description and documentation
- Breeding display to see which genes came from whom
  * Some kind of genealogical tree
- Settings file (?)
- Think of a better `__init__()` for Population
- Add loading placeholders in GUI
- Implement saving the progress of evolution (partially done)
- Think about passing all the parametres to the individuals (extra memory)
- Fitness_multiplier?
